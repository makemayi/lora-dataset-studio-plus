"""Run the fp8 export ON THE POD, at the end of a successful dense run.

WHY ON THE POD
--------------
The bf16 master is a ~26 GB file that already lives on the rented machine, next
to a GPU and a fast link to Hugging Face. Quantizing it there costs minutes of a
pod that is about to be destroyed anyway; quantizing it at home costs a 26 GB
download first, on a machine that may not have the RAM for it. The window is
narrow — after ``status == completed`` and before the instance is destroyed —
which is exactly where this module is called from.

HOW THE CODE GETS THERE
-----------------------
There is no shell in the ai-toolkit UI API, so this uses the two seams that do
exist:

* **write** — the pod's ``/api/datasets/upload`` route joins its ``datasetName``
  onto DATASETS_FOLDER with Node's ``path.join`` (which normalises ``..``), so a
  relative path lands a file in any directory. ``seed_checkpoint`` already
  relies on this to pre-place a checkpoint for auto-resume; here it ships
  ``fp8_export.py`` itself, byte for byte — the SAME file the unit tests
  exercise, so there is no second implementation to drift.
* **execute** — vast's asynchronous instance-command endpoint
  (``vast_client.execute_command``), which returns a URL where the combined
  output appears when the command ends.

FAIL-OPEN, ALWAYS
-----------------
Every failure in this module is recorded and swallowed. By the time it runs, the
trainer has already pushed the bf16 master to the private repo: the run is a
SUCCESS with or without an fp8 twin. Turning "the convenience export did not
work" into "the run failed" would throw away hours of paid GPU for a file the
user can regenerate.

WHAT IS PROVEN AND WHAT IS NOT
------------------------------
The quantizer is unit tested against real torch and its output was fed to
ComfyUI's own ``convert_old_quants``. The pod-side execution is NOT smoke tested
— no pod is rented by the test suite — so what is asserted here is the exact
command and payload that would be sent. That distinction is deliberate and is
the reason every step below reports its own state instead of assuming.
