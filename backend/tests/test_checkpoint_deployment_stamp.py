"""Deployment stamp on checkpoint lists — the ONE join between a run's saves and
their copies in ComfyUI.

The ◉ Graph pills and the "Checkpoints & LoRAs" panel must answer "is this
deployed, and which ComfyUI file would an undeploy remove?" identically: the
panel used to offer "Import →" on an already-deployed checkpoint and hide the
way back in another list. Both surfaces now go through
annotate_deployed_checkpoints.
