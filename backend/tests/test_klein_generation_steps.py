"""Klein GENERATION steps are a setting (raised by ashish.sinha on Discord:
"is the number of generation steps fixed at 5, cant we increase them").

They were: the shipped workflow hardcodes 5 at its sampler node and the
generation call sites never passed `sampler_steps`, so the parameter
enqueue_klein_edit had been written with was unreachable. `klein.generation_steps`
now feeds it, defaulting to 5 so an untouched install renders exactly as before.

(More steps improve the RENDER. They do not fix a prompt that describes the wrong
kind of subject — that is what the per-subject identity prompts are for, see
test_identity_prompt_subject_scope.)
